# Simple Queueing Simulation
A desktop application for a simple queueing simulation written in Java with JavaSwing and JavaAWT for Graphical User Interface.

## Technologies
- Java
- Java GUI (Java Swing and Java AWT)
- Netbeans IDE

## Requirements
The simulation consists of five replications. The interarrival and service time for each replication of the simulation are randomly generated (based from the table given below). The final output includes the following:
- Data tables for the random digit assignments with the corresponding interarrival and service times of each customer/part.
- Simulation table
- Performance measures for each replication which includes:
  - Average waiting time
  - Maximum waiting time
  - Time average number of customers in queue
  - Maximum number of parts in queue
  - Average and maximum total time in system
  - Utilization of the resource
  
_The simulation peroid is 40 minutes._

The tables below are the random digit assignments for interarrival and service times.

Interarrival Times (min) | Random Digit Assignment
------------------------ | -----------------------
1 | 001-124
2 | 125-250
3 | 251-375
4 | 376-500
5 | 501-625
6 | 626-750
7 | 751-875
8 | 876-000

Service Times | Random Digit Assignment
--------------| -----------------------
1 | 01-10
2 | 11-30
3 | 31-60
4 | 61-85
5 | 86-95
6 | 96-00
